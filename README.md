# house_price_prediction

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key property features. I began by collecting and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and creating new features such as house age and lot area per square foot to improve model accuracy. I explored various regression algorithms and ultimately selected the model that provided the best performance metrics.

For deployment, I created an interactive Streamlit web application where users can input property details like area, number of bedrooms, house type, and year built, and receive a predicted price instantly. The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a user-friendly interface.
